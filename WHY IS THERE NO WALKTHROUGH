I know one criteria was for a walkthrough of this app to deomnstrate functionality

Unfortunately, no matter how much I tinkered, it would not work on my computer - it would display the opening menu, then finish

My husband (25 years IT experience) tried unsuccessfully to debug it, and it still wouldn't work

A friend (25 years web developer experience) downloaded the files from my repository to her Mac ... and it worked.  Perfectly.  And she could find no errors in the code

So I redownloaded the files from the repository.  It still kept ending right after showing the main menu

I honestly don't know where to go from here.  Two professionals couldn't find the reason for it not working and couldn't find any bugs in my code to cause it

If you can shed light on it, I'd love to hear your feedback
